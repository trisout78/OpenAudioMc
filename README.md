- LiteBans support to synchronize mutes with voice chat
- Feature-rich Java API
- Easy to use web clients (players receive their link, no downloads or accounts required)
- Automatic client translation in 9 languages
- Automatic CDN infrastructure to speed up file delivery without any configuration
- Active support and community
- User Preferences and client settings

## Supported platforms
- [Spigot (1.8 and up)](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/openaudiomc-open-source-audio-client.30691/ "Spigot Plugin Page")
- [BungeeCord (recent builds)](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/openaudiomc-open-source-audio-client.30691/ "Spigot Plugin Page")
- [Velocity](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/openaudiomc-open-source-audio-client.30691/ "Spigot Plugin Page")

## Notes on testing
The Java plugin/implementation and vistas platforms come bundled with maven unit tests. All tests *must* pass before pull requests can definitively be reviewed.
Please note that the test for `vistas-server` test cases require a redis server to be running on `localhost:6379` with no password. These test cases will fail prematurely if this is not the case.

# Codebase core terminology
- **Platform**: refers to the server environment where OpenAudioMc is running, like Bungeecord, Spigot, Velocity and Standalone
- **Service**: Most of the internal codebase was re-written and refactored during the 6.5.5 update, where we migrated to a custom service manager with support for annotation based dependency injection, service abstraction and to provide pointer safety during reloads.
  The service manager is registered in the main OpenAudioMc class and is accessible through all platforms. The entire ecosystem consists of two main registration types. Services are static code implementations that can be injected, requested and manipulated after loading (or being requested, in which case they’ll be loaded if they weren’t already)
- **Module**: Modules are jar files with extra content, features or scripts that modify default OpenAudioMc behaviour. Usually used to integrate with third party plugins.

# Project structure
- `plugin/` contains the plugin and framework source code
- `client/` contains the source code, build scripts and assets of the production web client
- `modules/jutils` contains legacy java libraries that are only used during migrations
- `modules/migrator` contains the migrator that converts legacy MapDB database stores to Sqlite through Storm
- `modules/parties` contains the module integrating with the official [Parties](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/parties-an-advanced-parties-manager.3709/) plugin
- `modules/skywars` contains the module integrating with native Skywars game states ([Skywars Reloaded](https://github.com/lukasvdgaag/SkyWarsReloaded))
- `modules/vistas-server` a standalone OpenAudioMc installation that links over redis, for enterprise deployments with multiple bungee or lilypad proxies
- `modules/vistas-client` a plugin runtime implementation for vistas, to hook into a redis based mesh network
